## Features
- Audio synthesys via multiple engines ([Monosynth](https://dilber.io/docs/index.html#instruments-monosynth), [Polysynth](https://dilber.io/docs/index.html#instruments-synth), [FM synth](https://dilber.io/docs/index.html#instruments-fm) ...)
- Video synthesys using [Hydra Video Synth](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/), [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [marching.js](https://github.com/charlieroberts/marching)
- Audio and video sequencing (step sequencing, TydalCycles / Strudel notation ...)
- Sample mangling (see [sampler docs](https://dilber.io/docs/index.html#instruments-sampler))
- Edit sequences while running
- Audio effects <i>(BitCrusher, Delay, Filter, Distortion, Flanger, Reverb, RingMod, Vibrato, Tremolo, Wavefolder)</i>
- Video effects <i>(Antialiasing, Bloom, Blur, Brightness, Contrast, Edges, Focus, Godrays, Motion Blur, Hue, Invert)</i>
- Camera control <i>(WASD, arrows)</i>
- Live perform with friends: P2P realtime collaboration with shared editor and chat over secure sockets
- Saving and loading your dilber files from computer
- MIDI out for your external or hardware synths
- Render canvas to video with rec() command
- Works offline, too

## Use online samples with Sampler instrument

```
- Use a direct link to your sample as a parameter: Sampler('https://somewebsite.come/awesomesample.wav')

- Use any sound from [Freesound.org]('https://freesound.org/') library by ID: 
     Freesound(4048)

- Download samples by query: 
     Freesound('crickets')

- Get random samples:
     Freesound({ 
          query:'drums +90 +bpm', // search for drums, 90, and bpm
          max:5, 				 // max of five seconds in length
          single:false, 		 // files do not have to contain single sounds / notes
          filename:false,         // do not require query terms to be present in filename
          count:5,			 // load five samples...
          maxVoices:1			 // ... but only play one at a time
     })
```

## Use local samples with Sampler
```
For local samples:
 - Clone this repo and put your samples in `samples` folder
 - Open index.html on your local machine (you can use http-server or LiveServer in VS Code)
 - Use it in your code like a normal instrument: Sampler('yoursample.wav')
```

## Sequence external synths
```
 - Click on `midi out` button in top menu and select MIDI out device 
 - Send a MIDI NoteOn message with a value of 60 to channel 0: channels[0].midinote(60)
 - See MIDI Out tutorial in Dilber for more!
```
