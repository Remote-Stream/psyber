## Audio Instruments
     - FM
     - Pluck
     - Monosynth
     - Synth
     - Clap
     - Cowbell
     - Kick
     - Snare

## Visual libraries
     - 3D Raymarching
     - Hydra
     - P5.js

## Use online samples with Sampler instrument
```
- Use a direct link to your sample as a parameter: Sampler('https://somewebsite.come/awesomesample.wav')

- Use any sound from freesound.org library by ID: 
     Freesound(4048)

- Download samples by query: 
     Freesound('crickets')

- Get random samples:
     Freesound({ 
          query:'drums +90 +bpm', // search for drums, 90, and bpm
          max:5, 			    // max of five seconds in length
          single:false, 		    // files do not have to contain single sounds / notes
          filename:false,         // do not require query terms to be present in filename
          count:5,			    // load five samples...
          maxVoices:1		    // ... but only play one at a time
     })
```

## Use local samples with Sampler
```
 - Clone this repo and put your samples in `samples` folder
 - Open index.html on your local machine (you can use http-server or LiveServer in VS Code)
 - Use it in your code like a normal instrument: Sampler('yoursample.wav')
```

## Sequence external synths
```
 - Click on `midi out` button in top menu and select MIDI out device 
 - Send a MIDI NoteOn message with a value of 60 to channel 0: channels[0].midinote(60)
 - See MIDI Out tutorial in Dilber for more!
```

## Changes
```
- MIDI out support - controll your external synths with Dilber via WebMIDI
- Audio/Mic In
- Fully static app
- Simple folder structure:
  ./docs
  ./samples    <-- your samples go here
  ./resources  <-- all other files
   index.html  <-- Main page

- UI fixes for popups and notifications
- Removed most of redundant code and unnecesary files
- P2P WebSockets now works properly over wss server
- Added audio in via FFT.StartMic() command
- Added MouseY and MouseY parametars for modulating things from 0.0 to 1.0
- Added Load and Save functionality so you can export or load dilber files from your computer
- Improved error catching and logging
- Fixed audio when switching between examples
- Added missing sounds from examples
- Added rec(param) command to record canvas in video mode
     - rec() - records until you press CTRL+. command
     - rec(5) - e.g. records for 5 seconds
  ... many more
